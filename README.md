# paragraphtoexcel
Paragraph → rows

Why i did this ?
So, while copying and pasting the syllabus into the excel sheet,it was annoying to seperate the lines again and again, everything was coming in one line after copying and pasting



So the program separates it into rows,just by copying the syllabus into  a the ‘syllabus.csv’ file




Conditions:

1)Save the paragraph you want to separate into the ‘syllabus.csv’ file
2)The delimiter may vary according to what the rows are separated in YOUR paragraph.
3)the program would work better if the paragraph is in one line so copy-paste with formatting,
(if that doesn’t happen in your text editor directly, copy paste on word docs and then cut paste in the syllabus.csv file)
(4)If you aren’t familiar with the ‘with’ keyword, its alright don’t be afraid,just keep swimming :) )





(The paragraph in my syllabus: you can see it has ‘;’ for the main topics and ‘,’ for the subtopic)
(go through pdf vwrsion for images, the text is same . YEA.That's that)
